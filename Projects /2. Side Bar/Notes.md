1. ```<i>:``` This is an HTML tag traditionally used to render text in italic style. However, in modern web development, particularly with the use of icon libraries like FontAwesome, the <i> tag is often repurposed to display icons. This is not its semantic meaning, but it's a common practice due to its simplicity and convenience.

class="fas fa-qrcode": The class attribute is used here to apply CSS classes. In this context, fas and fa-qrcode are classes provided by the FontAwesome icon library. FontAwesome is a popular library used to add scalable vector icons to web projects.

fas stands for "FontAwesome Solid", indicating that the icon should be solid (as opposed to regular or light, which are other styles FontAwesome offers).
fa-qrcode specifies the particular icon to be used, in this case, a QR code icon.
